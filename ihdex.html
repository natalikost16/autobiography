        <li><strong>1840</strong> - the world first saw the Kobzar, Shevchenko's first collection of poetry. Later Ivan Franko wrote that this book, "immediately revealed, as it were, a new world of poetry. It burst forth like a spring of clear, cold water, and sparkled with a clarity, breadth and elegance of artistic expression not previously known in Ukrainian writing." </li>
        <li><strong>1841</strong> - the epic poem Haidamaky appeared as a separate volume. In September of that same year, Shevchenko got his third Silver Medal -- for his picture The Gypsy Fortune Teller. </li>

        <li><strong>1847</strong> - started to work a teacher of visual arts at the Kyiv University</li>
        <li><strong>1857</strong> - having received permission to travel to St. Petersburg, Shevchenko left the fort at Novopetrovsk </li>
        <li><strong>1961</strong> - he died </li>
